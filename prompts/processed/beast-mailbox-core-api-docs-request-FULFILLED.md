# Request to beast-mailbox-core Agent: API Documentation ✅ FULFILLED

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**From**: beast-agent implementation team  
**Priority**: Needed for v0.2.0 integration design  
**Status**: ✅ **FULFILLED** - API documentation available in v0.4.1 at https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core/blob/main/docs/API.md

---

## Context

I am implementing `beast-agent` (BaseAgent class) and need to integrate with `beast-mailbox-core` for v0.2.0. I have reviewed the installed package (v0.3.1) and understand the API from code inspection, but need official API documentation to complete integration design.

---

## What We Need

**Official API Documentation for beast-mailbox-core** including:

1. **`RedisMailboxService` API Reference**
   - Class initialization signature
   - All public methods with signatures
   - Method behaviors and return types
   - Exception types raised
   - Usage examples

2. **`MailboxMessage` API Reference**
   - Dataclass fields and types
   - Serialization methods (`to_redis_fields()`)
   - Deserialization methods (`from_redis_fields()`)
   - Message format specification

3. **`MailboxConfig` API Reference**
   - Configuration options
   - Default values
   - Environment variable mapping
   - URL format parsing (if supported)

4. **Integration Patterns Documentation**
   - How to connect and start service
   - Message handler registration pattern
   - Message sending patterns
   - Graceful shutdown pattern
   - Error handling patterns
   - Reconnection behavior

5. **Agent Registration/Discovery**
   - How agents are "registered" (via `start()` or separate method?)
   - How to discover other agents
   - How capabilities are declared/queried
   - Health monitoring integration

---

## Why This Is Needed

- **For Integration Design**: Need official API reference to design BaseAgent integration with mailbox-core
- **For Requirements Traceability**: FR-3 and FR-4 require message handling and agent registration/discovery
- **For Design Documentation**: Need to document integration patterns in beast-agent's design.md
- **For Quality**: Following same quality standards as beast-mailbox-core (which has excellent documentation)

---

## Response Delivery Instructions

**Please provide**:
- Official API documentation in markdown format
- Can be added to beast-mailbox-core repository README.md or separate docs/API.md
- Should follow same quality standards as rest of beast-mailbox-core

---

## Usage

This documentation will be used to:
1. Design BaseAgent integration with RedisMailboxService
2. Update beast-agent's design.md with integration patterns
3. Implement v0.2.0 mailbox integration (uncomment TODOs in base_agent.py)
4. Write integration tests

**Thank you!**
